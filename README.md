# Hi there! I'm MelshiD 👋

Welcome to my corner of the internet! 🌐 I'm a **Frontend Web Developer** by title, but the code I wrangle often transcends job descriptions. I build, maintain, and breathe life into full-stack systems across a variety of languages, often chasing grant deliverables that refuse to sit still. 🏗️

## 🌟 **About Me**
- 🎨 **Frontend Focus**: Crafting user-friendly, functional, and elegant UIs.
- 🔧 **Full-Stack Fixer**: From dusty legacy codebases to modern frameworks, I keep systems running smoothly.
- 🚀 **Technology Explorer**: Always exploring new tools, frameworks, and tech experiments — currently diving into **WebGL** and **AI-powered workflows**.
- 🛠️ **Multi-Language Generalist**: I've worked across **Node.js**, **PHP**, **Python**, and **More**.
- 🧩 **Problem Solver**: Projects pivot, tech stacks evolve, and I adapt; experimenting, and delivering solutions that work.

## 🧰 **Tech Stack & Tools**

Here are a few things I work with regularly (or have wrangled at some point):

- **Languages**: JavaScript (Node.js), PHP, Python 🐍, Google Apps Script
- **Frontend**: customElements, Vue, React, WebGL 🖌️, whatever design system you like
- **Backend**: PHP (sometimes Laravel/Inertia/Statamic), Node.js, Flask
- **Tools**: Git, NPM, Docker 🐳, ChatGPT
- **Design**: Illustrator, Figma, Canva, Dalle
- **Philosophy**: It'll take a different net to catch a rhino from the net to catch a birdie.

## 📚 **What Drives Me?**
- 🚴 **Exploration**: Whether it's the latest JavaScript framework, **WebGL experiments**, or working to scale myself with AI tools, I believe in hands-on discovery.
- 🤖 **AI Enthusiast**: Passionate about integrating AI tools to streamline workflows and enhance user experiences.
- 🧪 **Experimentation**: I share experiments and insights with the team because tech is better when it's collaborative.
- 🛤️ **Resilience**: My work in the nonprofit sector means projects can pivot fast. I have been successful in finding creative solutions to shifting challenges.

## 📈 **A Growth-Minded Developer**

I'm always working to **deepen** my expertise while navigating the breadth of my role. Being a developer isn't just about solving problems — it's about discovering them in the first place.

✨ I aim to write elegant, maintainable code that stands the test of time (and project pivots). I take pride in understanding the "why" behind what I build and empowering others through collaboration and shared knowledge.
