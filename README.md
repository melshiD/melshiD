- 👋 Hi, I’m @melshiD (Melshman most places online)
- 👀 I’m interested in blockchain development and implementation, learning new languages, working remotely and being surrounded by brilliant people.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity, the Truffle development framework and the Open Zeppelin libraries.  I'm planning to upskill my front-end dev skills next.  If you're
      a developer wanting to get into blockchain with as little pain as possible, check out the Ivan On Tech Blockchain Academy.  It's incredible, and no one payed me to say that.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can actually make a difference in people's lives and communities. 
- 📫 How to reach me:  Working on updating my LinkedIn.  I'll post more details in this sections shortly.
