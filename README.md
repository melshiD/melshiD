- 👋 Hi, I’m @melshiD (Melshman most places online)
- 👀 I’m currently immersed in becoming a web developer.  I got back into programming via blockchain, and have since fallen in love with the potential of the browser.
- 💞️ I hope to collaborate on and build projects that truly make a difference in people's lives and communities. 
- 📫 How to reach me:  Working on updating my LinkedIn.  I'll post more details in this sections shortly.
